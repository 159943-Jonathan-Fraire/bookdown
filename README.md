[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/bookdown.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/rstudio/bookdown)

Documentation at <https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown>, and see "Get Started" at <https://bookdown.org> to know how to get started with writing a book. This package is relatively stable now and can be used for beta testing. We may still introduce changes in the coming weeks, though. You are welcome to experiment with it and send us feedback using [Github issues](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues).
