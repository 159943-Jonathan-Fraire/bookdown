# CHANGES IN bookdown VERSION 0.2 (unreleased)

## NEW FEATURES

- Added two arguemnts `toc_unnumberred` and `toc_bib` to `pdf_book()`.

## MAJOR CHANGES

- The `force_knit` argument of `render_book()` was removed (to avoid confusion when switching output formats).

## MINOR CHANGES

- The merged R Markdown file will not be deleted if rendering failed so you can debug with this file (http://stackoverflow.com/q/38883222/559676).

## BUG FIXES

- Figures are not correctly numbered in Word output using the `bookdown::word_document2()` format (thanks, @byzheng, #158).

- For the "Knit and Merge" approach (`new_session: yes` in `_bookdown.yml`), certain parts like figures may not show up when switching from one output format to another (e.g. from HTML to LaTeX).

- The `rmd_files` option in `_bookdown.yml` does not work when it is a list of `html` and `latex` options (thanks, @ismayc, #177).
