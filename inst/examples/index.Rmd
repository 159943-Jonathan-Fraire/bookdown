# Introduction

This book is a guide to authoring books with R Markdown [@R-rmarkdown] and the R package **bookdown** [@R-bookdown]. It focuses on the features specific to writing books, long-form articles, or reports, such as

- How to typeset figures and tables, and cross-reference them;
- How to generate multiple output formats such as HTML, PDF, and E-Books for a single book;
- How to customize the book templates and style different elements in a book;
- The editor support (in particular, the RStudio IDE);
- How to publish a book;

It is not a comprehensive introduction to R Markdown or the **knitr** package, on top of which **bookdown** was built. To learn more about R Markdown, please check out the online documentation <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. For **knitr**, please see @xie2015. You do not have to be an expert of the R language [@R-base] to read this book, but you are expected to have some basic knowledge about R Markdown and **knitr**. For beginners, you may get started with the cheetsheets at <https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/>. To be able to customize the book templates and themes, you should be familiar with LaTeX, HTML and CSS.
