# FAQ

Below is the _complete_ list of frequently asked questions (FAQ). Yes, there is only one question here. I do not like FAQ's. They often mean surprises, and surprises are not good for software users.

1. Q: Will **bookdown** have the features X, Y, and Z?

    A: The short answer is no, but if you have asked yourself three times "do I really need them" and the answer is still "yes", please feel free to file a feature request to https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/issues, and I will see if God is going to kill a kitten.
